# MATLAB Iterative Second Order System Solver 
Creator: Ben Mighall

This is a MATLAB program that solves for x=-ln(0.02/(1+x)), where x = w_n\*T_s, using successive approximations and starting with an arbitrary positive value for x_0. Program is used to determine the 2% settling time for a standard second order system with a damping ratio of 1 (critically damped).

This program was written for University of Mississippi class EL E 431 (Theory of Control Systems).
